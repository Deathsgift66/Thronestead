# Kingdom Resources

The `kingdom_resources` table stores the on-hand stockpile for a player's kingdom. It acts as the "resource wallet" where all produced materials are deposited and from which costs are deducted.

## Table Structure

| `kingdom_id` | Which kingdom this row belongs to. Primary key. |

| `coal` | Coal supply. |
| `livestock` | Livestock. |

| `charcoal` | Charcoal. |
| `leather` | Leather. |
| `arrows` | Arrows. |

## Usage

### Showing resources in the UI
Query the row for the player's kingdom and display each column on the various economy screens.

```sql
SELECT *
FROM public.kingdom_resources
WHERE kingdom_id = 5;
```

### Producing resources
Add hourly or event production amounts to the row.

```sql
UPDATE public.kingdom_resources
SET wood = wood + 100,
    stone = stone + 50,
    food = food + 200
WHERE kingdom_id = 5;
```

### Spending resources
Always check the current values first and ensure they do not go negative when deducting costs.

```sql
SELECT wood, stone
FROM public.kingdom_resources
WHERE kingdom_id = 5;

UPDATE public.kingdom_resources
SET wood = wood - 100,
    stone = stone - 50
WHERE kingdom_id = 5;
```

### Taxes, trades and war loot
Alliance taxes withdraw from this table and deposit into `alliance_vault`. Trades and war loot transfer amounts between kingdoms by updating each kingdom's row.

## Best Practices

* Only one row exists per kingdom â€“ use `kingdom_id` as the primary key.
* Use `SELECT ... FOR UPDATE` when performing critical resource updates to avoid race conditions.
* Prevent negative values in application logic or with check constraints.
* Consider logging transactions in a separate `kingdom_resource_transaction_log` table for auditing.

### Programmatic Updates

The backend exposes helper functions in
[`services/resource_service.py`](../services/resource_service.py) for common
operations:

- `spend_resources(db, kingdom_id, cost)` deducts resources safely and raises
  an error if funds are insufficient.
- `gain_resources(db, kingdom_id, gain)` credits new resources to the kingdom.
- `get_kingdom_resources(db, kingdom_id, lock=False)` fetches the current
  ledger. Pass ``lock=True`` to acquire a `FOR UPDATE` lock for atomic updates.

Use these helpers when implementing features that modify `kingdom_resources` to
ensure consistent logging and validation.
